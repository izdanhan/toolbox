# Ollama Scripts

This folder contains **scripts and helpers for working with Ollama models**.  
Use it to organize your prompts, benchmark runs, and model helpers.

## Structure

- `examples/` → Example prompts, configs, or usage patterns.  
- `model_manager.sh` → Manage models (pull, remove, list).  
- `ollama_helper.sh` → Utility functions for running Ollama.  

## Usage

- Place reusable scripts here to automate Ollama workflows.  
- Keep all prompts in `examples/` for consistency.
