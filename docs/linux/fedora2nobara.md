### **The Recommended Step-by-Step Process:**

1.  **Backup (Non-Negotiable!):** Even though your `/home` is separate, ensure your critical documents, photos, and any other irreplaceable data are also copied to your backup HDD or external drive. This is your safety net.

2.  **Install Nobara:**
    *   Boot from the Nobara USB installer.
    *   When you get to the partitioning screen, choose **"Custom"** or **"Manual Partitioning"**.
    *   Select your **2TB 990 Pro SSD** to install onto.
    *   For the root partition (`/`):
        *   Select the existing partition you used for Fedora's root.
        *   Set its new mount point to `/`.
        *   **Check the box to *format* it.** Choose `btrfs` or `ext4` (Nobara defaults to btrfs, which is excellent for its snapshot feature). This gives you a clean system.
    *   For your `/home` partition:
        *   Select your existing `/home` partition.
        *   Set its mount point to `/home`.
        *   **CRUCIALLY: *UNCHECK* the box to format it.** You want to preserve all your data.
    *   Complete the installation. The installer will create a new user for you (e.g., `daniel`).

3.  **First Boot & The Cleanup:**
    *   Log into your new Nobara installation with the new user account you created. Your old home directory (e.g., `/home/daniel.old`) is still there, untouched.
    *   Open a terminal. Now, you have two user directories:
        *   `/home/daniel` (new, almost empty, owned by your new user)
        *   `/home/daniel.old` (old, with all your data, owned by your old user ID)
    *   The safest and most thorough way to handle this is to **become root** and move the data, preserving ownership and permissions. Run these commands carefully:

    ```bash
    # Become root (you'll need your password)
    sudo su -

    # Rename the NEW, empty home directory to a temporary name
    mv /home/daniel /home/daniel.new

    # Rename the OLD home directory to the correct name
    mv /home/daniel.old /home/daniel

    # Now, the crucial step: change the ownership of EVERYTHING in the old directory to your NEW user.
    # Replace 'daniel' with your new username if it's different.
    chown -R daniel:daniel /home/daniel

    # Exit the root shell
    exit
    ```

4.  **Log Out and Back In:** Log out of your session and log back in. Your system will now use the "new" (which is actually your old) `/home/daniel` directory with all your files, and everything will be owned by your current user, preventing permission errors.

5.  **Final Cleanup:** Once you've confirmed everything works—your files are there, applications run correctly—you can safely delete the temporary directory:
    ```bash
    rm -rf /home/daniel.new
    ```

### **Why This Method is Better Than a Simple Copy:**

*   **Preserves Everything:** A `mv` (move) command is instantaneous and doesn't risk corruption during a long copy process.
*   **Fixes Ownership:** The `chown -R` command is critical. Your old files were owned by your old user's ID (e.g., UID 1000 from Fedora). Your new Nobara user, even if also called `daniel`, might have a different UID (e.g., UID 1001). This change ensures your new user has full ownership of all the files, preventing "permission denied" errors.
*   **Avoids Config Conflicts:** You start with a fresh OS configuration (in `/`) while keeping all your personal data and *most* application settings. This is the ideal scenario. Some app configs might need tweaking if they are from a different version, but it's far cleaner than bringing over everything.

Enjoy your new, optimized Nobara setup! This process will give you a clean system foundation while retaining all your valuable data and customizations.
