Excellent. Thank you for the detailed answers. This gives me a very clear picture of your goals and the pain points you want to solve. Your setup is fantastic, and with a few strategic changes, we can make it incredibly efficient.

Based on your feedback, here is a comprehensive plan. The overarching philosophy is: **"The right tool for the right job, with seamless data access between them."**

### **Phase 1: Desktop OS & Storage Strategy (The Powerhouse)**

Your desktop is your primary workhorse. Let's assign tasks to the OS that handles them best.

**1. Operating System Allocation:**

*   **Linux (Fedora / Nobara) on the 2TB Samsung 990 Pro SSD:**
    *   **Why here?** This is your fastest drive. It should host your primary creative and development OS for the best performance.
    *   **Primary Tasks:**
        *   Video Editing with DaVinci Resolve (You can use the free version or consider the Studio version for Linux, which unlocks GPU encoding and is a one-time purchase).
        *   AI Work (Ollama, Krita AI, Stable Diffusion)
        *   General Development & "trying all kind of stuff"
        *   Photo editing with Darktable & Krita
    *   **Distro Suggestion:** Stay with **Fedora** if you love it. However, I strongly recommend trying **Nobara**. It's a Fedora-based distro maintained by GloriousEggroll (a key Proton-GE developer) that comes pre-configured with all the codecs, kernel patches, and drivers for gaming and media creation. It solves the H.264/H.265 issue out of the box and often has better NVIDIA driver integration. It's the perfect blend of Fedora's modernity and tailored performance.

*   **Windows 11 on the 1TB Samsung 980 SSD:**
    *   **Why here?** Dedicate this OS to what it does best.
    *   **Primary Tasks:**
        *   **Gaming on your TV:** This is the key. Windows will give you the full 120Hz VRR, HDR, and Dolby Digital audio passthrough to your soundbar without any fuss.
        *   Gaming on your main desktop displays for titles with anti-cheat that doesn't work on Linux.
        *   Using the **Affinity Suite** with full performance.
        *   **Philips Hue Sync** for immersive TV and gaming experiences.

**2. Data Storage & Filesystems:**

*   **2TB HDD (TV/Movies):** Format as **NTFS**. This is the most reliable for read/write across both Windows and Linux. You can mount it automatically in both OSes.
*   **2TB HDD (Backups):** Format as **NTFS** or **ext4**. Since it's for backups, if your backup tool is Linux-based (e.g., Borg, `rsync`), use `ext4`. If you use a Windows backup tool, use NTFS. For simplicity, NTFS is fine.
*   **500GB SATA SSD:** Perfect as your **Linux Distro Testing drive**. You can install multiple distributions here to satisfy your distro-hopping needs without touching your main production OS. Use `ext4`.

**3. The External SSD (Samsung T7):**

Reformat this to serve two clear purposes. We'll create two partitions:

*   **Partition 1 (~1.5TB): Format as exFAT**
    *   **Purpose:** Your **cross-platform projects drive**.
    *   Use this to actively work on video and photo projects. You can start a edit on your laptop's Linux, plug it into your desktop's Linux or Windows to continue in DaVinci Resolve, or use the Affinity suite on Windows. `exFAT` is perfect for this as it has no file size limits and works everywhere.
*   **Partition 2 (~500GB): Format as ext4 (optionally with LUKS2)**
    *   **Purpose:** **Dedicated Linux Backup drive**.
    *   Use this *only* with Timeshift and Déjà Dup for your laptop and maybe your desktop's `/home` directory. Keeping backups on a separate partition from your projects prevents accidental data loss if a backup tool misbehaves.

### **Phase 2: Laptop OS Strategy (The Portable Unit)**

Your laptop is powerful but its role is less defined. Let's give it one.

*   **Primary OS: Linux (Fedora / Nobara)**
    *   Use the entire 2TB SSD for Linux. A 32GB RAM laptop is overkill for just web browsing; this should be a capable mobile editing and development station.
    *   **Primary Tasks:**
        *   Photo editing and light video editing on the go using the external T7 SSD.
        *   Development and AI experimentation.
        *   All your general computing needs.
*   **Windows on Laptop: Skip the Dual-Boot.**
    *   Your desktop handles the "need Windows" tasks perfectly. Adding a dual-boot on the laptop complicates it for a use case you've described as non-mandatory.
    *   **Solution for occasional Windows needs:** Use a **Windows Virtual Machine (VM)**. With 32GB of RAM, you can easily allocate 8-16GB to a Windows VM using **GNOME Boxes** or **Virtual Machine Manager**. This is perfect for the rare occasion you need to run a Windows-only application away from your desk. Your Windows 11 Pro license allows for this virtualization.

### **Phase 3: Software & Configuration Recommendations**

*   **Linux (Desktop & Laptop):**
    *   **Video Editing:** DaVinci Resolve. Nobara will include the required codecs.
    *   **Photo Editing:** Darktable (RAW development) + Krita (manipulation/painting).
    *   **AI:** Ollama, OCIO (for Stable Diffusion).
    *   **TV Gaming Workaround (for Linux):** If you *must* game from Linux on the TV, look into **Sunshine (server) + Moonlight (client)**. You can stream the game from your Windows installation to the Linux desktop, getting the Windows performance with the Linux convenience. It's a fantastic solution for in-home streaming.
*   **Windows (Desktop):**
    *   For gaming, ensure **Game Mode** is on and **HDR** is calibrated in Windows settings.
    *   Install **Philips Hue Sync** for the immersive lighting.

### **Summary of Your New Setup:**

| Component | OS / Purpose | Filesystem | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Desktop 2TB NVMe** | **Linux (Nobara)** | `btrfs` or `ext4` | Primary OS for creation & AI. |
| **Desktop 1TB NVMe** | **Windows 11** | NTFS | Dedicated to TV gaming & Affinity apps. |
| **Desktop 500GB SATA** | Distro Testing | `ext4` | Satisfy your distro-hopping itch. |
| **Desktop 2TB HDD** | Media Library | **NTFS** | Accessible from both OSes. |
| **Desktop 2TB HDD** | Backups | NTFS | |
| **Laptop 2TB NVMe** | **Linux (Nobara)** | `btrfs` or `ext4` | Primary OS, no dual-boot. Use a VM for Windows. |
| **External T7 SSD (P1)** | Projects | **exFAT** | Cross-platform project files. |
| **External T7 SSD (P2)** | Linux Backups | `ext4` (LUKS) | Timeshift, Déjà Dup. |

This structure gives you clear pathways, maximizes the strengths of each operating system, and uses your hardware to its full potential while keeping your data accessible and organized.
