# Workflows

This folder contains **step-by-step guides** for recurring tasks.

Examples:  
- `alias_management.md` → How to manage and sync your shell aliases.  
- `repo_sync.md` → How to keep repositories updated across machines.  
- `shell_scripting.md` → Common patterns for writing shell scripts.  

Tip: Keep each guide **short, clear, and actionable**. If something grows large, link out to more detailed references in `git/`, `linux/`, or `system/`.
