## ✍️ Best Practices for Docs

- Keep guides **short and practical** — straight to the point.  
- Store detailed workflows separately under `workflows/`.  
- Use `linux/` for common command tips, cheatsheets, and references.  
- If a document grows too big, split it into smaller files and cross-reference.  
- Use **clear, descriptive filenames** like `git_cheatsheet.md` or `file_permissions.md`.  

---

## 🌱 How to Expand

- Add **new cheatsheets** when you repeat tasks often.  
- Document **solutions to errors/problems** you encounter.  
- Write **step-by-step workflows** in `workflows/` when solving multi-step problems.  
- Keep everything versioned in Git so your knowledge base grows with your experience.

## 📌 Example Documents

- `git/git_cheatsheet.md` → Quick Git commands and workflows  
- `linux/linux_tips.md` → Useful Linux commands and references  
- `system/file_permissions.md` → Best practices for managing permissions  
- `workflows/alias_management.md` → How to organize and sync your shell aliases

This folder should grow into your **personal operations manual** — practical, detailed, and always at hand.
