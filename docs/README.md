# Documentation (docs)

This folder collects all written references, guides, cheatsheets, and best practices.  
It acts as your **knowledge base** for Linux, Git, system administration, workflows, and general tips.

## Structure

```
docs
├── git/             # Git usage, workflows, version control tips
├── linux/           # Linux tips, command references, and cheatsheets
├── system/          # System administration & security best practices
└── workflows/       # Custom workflows and "how-to" guides
```

---

## Best Practices

- Keep guides **short and practical** — straight to the point.  
- Store detailed workflows separately under `workflows/`.  
- Use `linux/` for common command tips, cheatsheets, and references.  
- If a document grows too big, split it into smaller files and cross-reference.  
- Use **clear file names** like `git_cheatsheet.md` or `file_permissions.md`.

## Example Documents

- `git/git_cheatsheet.md` → Quick commands and workflows for Git  
- `linux/linux_tips.md` → Useful Linux one-liners and references  
- `system/file_permissions.md` → Best practices for managing permissions  
- `workflows/alias_management.md` → How to organize and sync your shell aliases

This folder should grow over time into your **personal knowledge hub**.
