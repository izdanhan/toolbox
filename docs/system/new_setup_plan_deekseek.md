Excellent. This is a fantastic setup, and with a bit of organization, you can create a powerhouse workflow that perfectly blends your love for Linux tinkering with the raw production power of Windows. Let's build your complete system.

Based on our conversation, here is the definitive, highly detailed guide to setting up your hardware and software for your goals.

### **Philosophy & Core Principle**

Your setup will follow a "Right Tool for the Right Job" philosophy:
*   **Windows 11:** Your **Production OS**. Used for GPU-accelerated editing in DaVinci Resolve, using your Affinity Suite license, and high-performance gaming with HDR/VRR on your TV.
*   **Fedora Linux:** Your **Daily Driver & Tinkering OS**. Used for learning open-source creative tools (Kdenlive, Darktable), coding, and everything else you love about Linux.
*   **Project Data is Sacred:** Your project files and folder structure will be consistent and cross-platform. The OS you boot into is just a different set of tools opening the same project.

### **Phase 1: Hardware & Drive Allocation (The Foundation)**

This is the most critical step. We will assign each drive a specific role to maximize performance and avoid clutter.

**Desktop Drive Layout:**

| Drive | Capacity | Format | Purpose | OS Access |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Samsung 990 Pro** | 2 TB | NTFS | **Windows OS + Active Projects** | Windows (C:\) |
| | | | - Windows 11 | |
| | | | - All installed Apps (Resolve, Affinity, Games) | |
| | | | - `C:\MediaProjects\` (Active projects folder) | |
| **Samsung 980** | 1 TB | ext4 | **Fedora KDE Plasma** | Linux (/) |
| | | | - Full Linux OS + Home directory | |
| | | | - Linux app installs (Kdenlive, etc.) | |
| | | | - Linux-specific cache (pointed to `/mnt/cache`) | |
| **Samsung 850 EVO** | 500 GB | NTFS | **Dedicated Scratch & Cache Drive** | Windows (D:\) & Linux (/mnt/scratch) |
| | | | - DaVinci Resolve Cache | |
| | | | - Affinity Scratch Disk | |
| | | | - Blender Temp Files | |
| | | | - OBS Recordings (before moving to archive) | |
| **HDD #1** | 2 TB | NTFS | **Media Archive & Library** | Windows (E:\) & Linux (/mnt/archive) |
| | | | - `E:\MediaProjects\` (Master copy of all finished projects) | |
| | | | - `E:\MediaLibrary\` (For Kodi - Movies, TV Shows) | |
| | | | - `E:\FootageLibrary\` (Raw camera footage archive) | |
| **HDD #2** | 2 TB | NTFS | **Backup (Mirror of HDD #1)** | Windows (F:\) & Linux (/mnt/backup) |
| | | | - Use FreeFileSync (Win) or `rsync` (Linux) to regularly mirror HDD#1 -> HDD#2. | |
| **Samsung T7** | 2 TB | exFAT | **Portable Project Drive** | Both OSes |
| | | | - For moving active projects between Desktop and Laptop. | |

**Laptop Drive Layout:**
*   **Samsung 990 EVO:** 2 TB, ext4. **Single-boot Fedora Workstation (GNOME)**.
*   **Use the T7 external SSD** to transfer projects from your desktop.

### **Phase 2: Operating System & Software Configuration**

**1. Windows 11 (on 990 Pro) - The Power Tool:**
*   **NVIDIA Drivers:** Install Studio Drivers for best creative app stability.
*   **HDR & VRR:** Calibrate HDR in Windows Settings. Enable VRR/G-SYNC for your main monitor and TV.
*   **Essential Software:**
    *   **DaVinci Resolve (Free):** Your main video editor on this OS.
    *   **Affinity Photo/Designer/Publisher:** Your main design suite.
    *   **OBS Studio:** Set recording path to `D:\OBSRecordings\`.
    *   **Kodi:** Point its libraries to `E:\MediaLibrary\`.
    *   **FreeFileSync:** For easy backup to HDD#2.

*   **Configuration:**
    *   **DaVinci Resolve:** Go to `Preferences > Media Storage`. Add `D:\` (the scratch drive) to the top of the list for cache.
    *   **Affinity Suite:** Go to `Preferences > Performance`. Set the Scratch Disk to `D:\AffinityScratch\`.

**2. Fedora KDE (on 980) - The Workshop:**
*   **Install:** Use the official KDE spin.
*   **NTFS Access:** Install `ntfs-3g` to seamlessly read/write to your Windows and archive drives.
*   **Mount Points:** Configure `/etc/fstab` to auto-mount your drives on boot:
    *   `D:\` (850 EVO) -> `/mnt/scratch` (for cross-platform cache)
    *   `E:\` (HDD#1) -> `/mnt/archive`
    *   `F:\` (HDD#2) -> `/mnt/backup`
*   **Essential Software:** Install via Flathub for simplicity and containment.
    *   `flatpak install flathub org.kde.kdenlive`
    *   `flatpak install flathub org.darktable.Darktable`
    *   `flatpak install flathub org.kde.digikam`
    *   `flatpak install flathub org.kde.krita`
    *   `flatpak install flathub org.blender.Blender`
    *   `flatpak install flathub org.obsproject.Studio`

**3. Fedora GNOME (on Laptop) - The Satellite:**
*   Set up similarly to your desktop Fedora, with mounts for any external drives you connect.

### **Phase 3: The Universal Project Workflow**

This is the system that ties everything together. **You will use this folder structure on every drive and for every project.**

**Folder Structure Template:**
```
MediaProjects/
│
├── Project_2025-09-09_YouTubeIntro/  // Use a consistent naming convention!
│   ├── 01_Footage/                   // RAW camera files. NEVER edit these directly.
│   ├── 02_Audio/                     // Music, SFX, voice recordings
│   ├── 03_Assets/                    // Graphics, logos, lower thirds, photos
│   ├── 04_ProjectFiles/              // .drp (Resolve), .kdenlive, .afdesign, .blend
│   ├── 05_Exports/                   // Final rendered videos
│   └── 06_Cache/                     // Program-specific cache (safe to delete)
│
└── SharedAssets/                     // Global assets for all projects
    ├── Music/
    ├── SoundFX/
    ├── LUTs/
    ├── Overlays/
    └── Fonts/
```

**Step-by-Step Daily Use:**

1.  **Ingest:** After shooting, copy all footage from your camera to `E:\MediaProjects\Project_Name\01_Footage\` (on the Archive HDD). This is your **master, never-to-be-deleted copy**.
2.  **Activate:** Copy the *entire* project folder from `E:\MediaProjects\Project_Name\` to your fast active workspace:
    *   If editing in **Windows**: `C:\MediaProjects\Project_Name\`
    *   If editing in **Linux**: `/home/YourUser/MediaProjects/Project_Name/`
3.  **Edit:** Work on your project. All software should save its project file to the `04_ProjectFiles/` folder.
4.  **Export:** Render your final video to the `05_Exports/` folder.
5.  **Archive:** Once the project is finished and exported, **move the entire folder** from your fast NVMe drive (`C:\` or `~/`) back to its original location on the archive HDD (`E:\`). This frees up precious SSD space. Your master footage and final export are now safely together on the HDD.
6.  **Backup:** Run your mirroring tool (FreeFileSync/rsync) to copy the contents of `E:\` (HDD#1) to `F:\` (HDD#2).

### **Phase 4: Peripheral & Quality-of-Life Setup**

*   **Pen Display (Kamvas 16):** Will work best on **Windows**. Install the official Huion drivers for full pressure sensitivity and shortcut support. On Linux, it will likely work as a basic display with limited pressure levels without significant configuration.
*   **TV & Soundbar:** Connect directly to your **Desktop's NVIDIA GPU** via HDMI 2.1. Set it up as a separate display in Windows. Use it for:
    *   **Gaming:** Enable HDR and VRR in Windows settings and in-game.
    *   **Media Playback:** Use Kodi in full-screen mode.
    *   **Color Grading:** In DaVinci Resolve, you can use the "Video Clean Feed" output to send a full-screen, interface-free preview to the TV for a more accurate view.
*   **Camera (EOS R50):**
    *   **Shoot in:** MP4 (H.264) for simplicity to start. As you learn, experiment with C-Log3 if you want to try color grading.
    *   **Audio:** The VideoMic GO II is a great start. Always record a "room tone" (1-2 minutes of silence) to use for noise reduction in editing.
*   **Philips Hue:** Use the Hue Sync app on **Windows** to sync your lights to your games or movies on the TV for an immersive experience.

This setup gives you a incredibly powerful, organized, and flexible environment. You can seamlessly switch between a professional-grade production studio (Windows) and a fun, open-source learning lab (Linux) without ever losing your place. Enjoy your new creative journey
