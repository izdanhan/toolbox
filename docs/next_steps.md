## 1. Explore Existing Scripts

- Run system benchmarks in `system/benchmarks/`
- Try `utils/backup/backup.sh` for simple backup workflows
- Explore `ollama/` if you use Ollama models

---

## 2. Grow Your Knowledge Base

- Add your own Linux tips into `docs/linux/`
- Expand `docs/git/` with your workflows and cheatsheets
- Document recurring tasks in `docs/workflows/`

---

## 3. Maintain the Toolbox

- Use the [Toolbox Maintenance Guide](docs/workflows/toolbox_maintenance.md) for a checklist on keeping this repo clean, organized, and synced
- Add new folder-level `README.md` files when needed
- Keep aliases, scripts, and docs consistent

---

## 4. Sync Across Machines

- Set up SSH keys for GitHub if you havenâ€™t already
- Use `./sync_repos.sh` to keep local and remote in sync
- Clone the repo on new machines into `~/Projects/github/toolbox`

---

## 5. Keep Expanding

- Add new categories of scripts under `system/` or `utils/`
- Create templates for workflows you repeat often
- Write short, actionable guides in `docs/workflows/`

This repo is meant to **grow over time** into your central knowledge and tools hub.
