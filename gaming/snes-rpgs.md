# Super Nintendo - The Legendary RPGs

The SNES is often called the "Golden Age of RPGs" for a reason. While my previous list hit the mainstream giants, there is a second layer of "Legendary" RPGs—many of which were so advanced they pushed the SNES hardware to its absolute limit.

Since you are using an iPhone, these are especially great because RPGs (being turn-based) are very comfortable to play with touch controls.

### 1. The "Quintet Trilogy" (Action-RPGs)

If you liked *Zelda: A Link to the Past*, these are essential. They follow a loose "rebuilding the world" theme.

* **Soul Blazer:** You descend to Earth to free the souls of living creatures and rebuild towns. Satisfying and simple.
* **Illusion of Gaia:** A more linear, story-heavy adventure where you transform into different forms (like a dark knight) to solve puzzles.
* **Terranigma:** Widely considered the "hidden" masterpiece of the SNES. It was never released in North America (only Japan and Europe). It has some of the best graphics and music on the system.

### 2. The "Super FX" and High-Tech Powerhouses

These games came out late in the SNES life cycle and used special chips or massive file sizes to do things the SNES shouldn't have been able to do.

* **Tales of Phantasia:** This game actually features **full voice acting** in the opening song and during battles—a feat thought impossible for a cartridge. It's the start of the massive *Tales of* franchise.
* **Star Ocean:** Developed by the same team as *Tales*, this is a sci-fi/fantasy epic with a complex crafting system and some of the most detailed pixel art ever made.
* **Final Fantasy V:** Often overshadowed by *IV* and *VI*, this game has the best **Job System** in the series. You can customize your characters' classes (Ninja, Blue Mage, Chemist, etc.) with incredible depth.

### 3. Strategy & Tactical RPGs

If you like thinking five moves ahead:

* **Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War:** Dark, epic, and massive. It features a "generations" system where the choices of the parents affect the stats of the children. (Requires a fan translation patch).
* **Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together:** The predecessor to *Final Fantasy Tactics*. It is a grim, branching political drama where your choices lead to very different endings.
* **Ogre Battle: The March of the Black Queen:** A unique blend of real-time strategy and RPG. You manage units across a large map.

### 4. The "Weird & Wonderful" Classics

* **Secret of Evermore:** The only Square RPG developed in North America. It’s about a boy and his dog traveling through different time periods (Prehistoric, Roman, etc.). The dog changes shape in every era!
* **Live A Live:** You play seven different short stories across time (a Cowboy, a Ninja, a Robot in space) before they all converge in a final chapter. (Recently remade for Switch, but the SNES original is still legendary).
* **Lufia II: Rise of the Sinistrals:** The best "Zelda-style" puzzles found in a turn-based RPG. It also features the "Ancient Cave," a 99-floor randomly generated dungeon.

### How to play the "Japan-only" games?

Several of these (*Terranigma*, *Tales of Phantasia*, *Fire Emblem*) weren't released in the US. To play them on **Delta**, you'll need to find **English Fan Translation** versions of the ROMs.
