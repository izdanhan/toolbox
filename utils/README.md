# Utility Scripts

This folder contains **general-purpose helper scripts**.  
They are small, reusable tools that don’t belong under `system/` or `ollama/`.

## Structure

- `backup/` → Backup & restore scripts.  
- `timers/` → Stopwatch, countdown, time tracking tools.  
- `misc/` → Small one-off utilities that don’t fit elsewhere.  

---

Tip: Keep scripts simple and self-contained.  
If a script grows large or overlaps with another area, move it to a dedicated folder.
