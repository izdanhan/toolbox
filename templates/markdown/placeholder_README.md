# Placeholder README

This is a **template placeholder** README file.  
Use it when creating new folders to ensure they are tracked by GitHub, even if empty.

## Usage

1. Copy this file into the new folder.
2. Rename it to `README.md` (if not already).
3. Adjust the content to describe the purpose of the folder when you add real files.

Keeping placeholders ensures your repo structure is always consistent.
