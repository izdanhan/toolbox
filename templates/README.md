## ðŸ“– Navigation

- [bash/](bash/) â†’ Templates for shell scripts with headers and best practices.  
- [markdown/](markdown/) â†’ Documentation templates and structured examples.  

---

## ðŸ›  Best Practices

- Keep templates **minimal but structured**.  
- Use placeholders (e.g., `TODO`, `<project-name>`) to make them adaptable.  
- Always include a **header section** in scripts with:  
  - Description  
  - Author  
  - Date  
  - Usage instructions  
- In Markdown, use consistent headings and sections to make docs easier to scan.  

---

## ðŸ’¡ Example Use Cases

- **Bash**: Start new system scripts with logging and error handling already included.  
- **Markdown**: Begin a new guide, cheatsheet, or README with a consistent format.

This folder ensures your work always begins with a **solid, reusable foundation** instead of starting from scratch.
