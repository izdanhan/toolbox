# Templates

This folder contains **starter templates for scripts and documentation**.  
They serve as a quick way to create new, consistent files across the repo.

## Structure

- `bash/` → Boilerplate for new Bash scripts.  
- `markdown/` → Example structure for new documentation files.  

---

Tip: When creating a new script or doc, copy from here instead of starting from scratch.
